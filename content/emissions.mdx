# Emissions

The initial supply of `$AERO` is 500M, with 450M distributed as vote-locked
(`$veAERO`) tokens.

Weekly emissions will begin at 10M `$AERO` (2% of the initial supply). The
emission schedule will follow three phases:

**Take-off**: During the first 14 weeks (epochs), emissions will increase at 3% per
week, allowing for rapid growth in protocol activity and partner onboarding.

**Cruise**: After Epoch 14, emissions will decay at 1% per epoch, ensuring total
supply inflation decreases over time as the protocol matures.

**Aero Fed**: When emissions programmatically drop under 9M per epoch,
approximately Epoch 67, veAERO voters will take control of Aerodrome's monetary
policy through the Aero Fed system. Voters will collectively make one of three
choices each epoch:

- Increase emissions by 0.01% of total supply (0.52% annualized)
- Decrease emissions by 0.01% of total supply (0.52% annualized)
- Maintain emissions unchanged as a % of total supply

The winning vote will be determined by simple majority vote. If an Increase or Decrease is selected, the emission rate will change one full epoch after the vote. A max emission rate will be set at 1% of total supply per week (52% annualized) and a minimum rate at 0.01% per week (0.52% annualized).

## Rebase

`$veAERO` holders receive a rebase proportional to `$AERO` emissions and to the
ratio of `$veAERO` to `$AERO` supply, reducing vote power dilution for
`$veAERO`!

<br />

The weekly rebase amount is calculated with the following formula:

> rebase = weeklyEmissions × (1 - veAERO.totalSupply ÷ AERO.totalsupply)ˆ2 × 0.5

This rebase formula will reward `$veAERO` holders most when locking rates
decrease, incentivizing new lockers to step in. `$veAERO` supply does not
affect weekly emissions distributed to liquidity providers.

## Projected Emission Schedule

**Note**: _projection below uses a 40% emissions lock rate and assumes Aero Fed keeps emissions constant_.

## Emission Rewards

Each epoch, `$AERO` emissions are distributed to liquidity pools proportionally
to the `$veAERO` voting power the pools receive.

Liquidity providers (LPs) can stake their LP positions to receive a share of
the `$AERO` distributed to each pool proportionally to the size of positions
and time staked.

These rewards are distributed during the whole epoch and available for claiming
as these accrue.

## Team Emissions

While a fully autonomous and immutable protocol is an admirable objective, it
comes at a cost. Aerodrome will ensure its long-term sustainability by
employing a dedicated team focused on supporting the product decentralization,
documentation, community, and ecosystem.

To cover ongoing expenses and all the upcoming development efforts, 5% of the
emissions will be going to the team address.
