1. The protocol is designed to enable token swaps and generate fees (from
   **Traders**) by attracting liquidity.
2. Every epoch liquidity providers (**LPs**) receive `$AERO` token
   emissions proportionally to the votes the pools accumulate.
   Only staked (in the protocol gauges) liquidity receive emissions.
3. Participants can lock their `$AERO` to be able to vote
   on the next epoch distribution of emissions, becoming **veAERO Voters**.
4. **veAERO Voters** are rewarded (proportionally to locked amounts) for their
   votes with 100% of the protocol trading fees from the previous epoch and any
   additional voters incentives from the current epoch.
5. An epoch is a 7-day period. It starts every Thursday at 00:00 UTC and ends
   Wednesday at 23:59 UTC. Votes, emissions, fees, and incentives are
   calculated for each epoch.
