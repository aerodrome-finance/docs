# Voting

$veAERO holders decide which liquidity pools receive $AERO emissions. In return, voters receive 100% of the trading fees and bribes collected from the liquidity pool they vote for.

## Instructions

Distribute 100% of your Lock's (veNFT) vote-power among your preferred pools and Cast your vote. Repeat for each of your Locks (veNFTs). Unallocated vote-power (if {'<'} 100%) will be split proportionally among the selected pools. Each Lock (veNFT) can only cast votes once per epoch.

If you increased your Lock's (veNFT) balance during the epoch, recast your vote to allocate your vote-power in full. Unchanged votes carry over into the next epoch.

## Timeline

Votes for the next epoch, are due by Wednesday at 23:00 UTC, 1 hour before next epoch begins. During the following two hours, no voting operations will take place as this time is reserved for protocol operations/automations.

## Rewards

Voting rewards for a given epoch will appear in your Dashboard after the epoch change on Thursday at 00:00 UTC. Rebase rewards for new locks will appear after the second epoch change.
