# Relay

Relay was designed to automate the process of managing veNFTs:

- Users deposit their veNFTs into the available Relay strategy.
- All the voting and claiming is optimally done by the strategy automation.
- Rewards are converted into the strategy asset or compounded back increasing
  the deposited veNFT balance, all as part of the automation!

    <Alert color="warning">
      Depositing into a strategy will extend your veNFT unlock date to maximum!
    </Alert>
  }
</div>

Withdrawal of the veNFTs is possible only after the first week. Please make
sure the automation was run before you withdraw, the latest update date
should be recent.

### Compounders

Compounding strategies are designed to claim all the rebase and the voting
rewards. The rewards are converted and locked back into the veNFT balances.

This strategy was designed for users who want to increase their voting power!

### Convertors

Convertor strategies are designed to claim all the rebases and the voting
rewards. While the rebases are compounded back into the veNFTs, the rewards
are converted into the strategy asset (eg. USDC, ETH) and are shown
for every depositor when available for claiming.

### Relays run by the Protocol

The **veAERO MAXI** Relay is a compounder strategy that does the following:

- Votes to optimally achieve the maximum rewards available.
- Claims the rebase.
- Claims & converts rewards into Aero.
- Locks all converted Aero increasing the locked amount of those who deposited into the Relay.

### Relays run by or for the Protocol Partners

These Relay strategies are either run by or for the protocol partners,
usually other protocols with the goal of supporting the partner liquidity pools.

These strategies generally vote to support their own liquidity and
thus those who deposit into those pools.

In comparison to the veAERO Maxi, these relays will likely achieve smaller rewards,
but more consistent rewards for their pools.

Partner protocols can request a Relay strategy, this will soon require an open governance
proposal to be voted and passed by the veAERO voters.

Compounder strategy:

- Votes on the partners chosen pool to direct emissions.
- Claims the rebase.
- Claims & converts rewards into Aero.
- Locks all converted Aero increasing the locked amount of the partners veNFT Relay position.

### Architecture

The strategies are simple smart contracts that operate a specially managed
veNFT, also known as (m)veNFT.

The (m)veNFTs can be minted or deactivated by the protocol Governor and carry
no voting power initially, instead, these aggregate the voting power of any
regular deposited veNFTs. Once withdrawn, the regular veNFTs receive a share of
the aggregated voting power and the unlock date is set to maximum.

Owners of these (m)veNFTs can vote, claim rebases and collect rewards. That is
why these are usually granted to protocols or managers of the Relay strategies.

In case of an issue with one of the (m)veNFTs, these get deactivated and the
depositors will have to withdraw safely their veNFTs.

Relay was designed to solve the partner protocol needs and provide a flexible
way to build strategies on top of (m)veNFTs. Relay strategies are automated and
operated by a decentralized network, with the exception of the voting, which is
handled by the (m)veNFT managers.

### Governance

The depositors are still able to exercise their governance voting power. The
Governor will report the up-to-date locked amount of the veNFTs managed by a
Relay strategy.
