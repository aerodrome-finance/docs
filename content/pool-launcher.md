# Launcher

Aero Launcher is the easiest way for anybody to set up a liquidity market for
their token.

The flow guides through every step of
* creating the right pool type
* pairing with a curated tokens for the best distribution
* pricing and setting up the correct price range
* understanding the impact of the price and supply on the market cap
* locking the liquidity and staking


## Locking

Liquidity launched and locked with the launcher will show up in the dashboard
just like any existing deposits.

Locked deposits accept additional liquidity to be added, but do not allow
changes to the price range or withdrawals.

Locked deposits can be staked and unstaked if staking rewards are available.

Locked deposits allow a share of the accrued fees or rewards to be used for
incentives. The incentives can be done only by the owner of the locked
deposit and only for the same liquidity pool. The share of the incentives in
percentages can be adjusted.

Once the deposit lock date is reached, the deposit can be unlocked by the owner
and managed just like a regular deposit.

## Emerging Liquidity

New launches can show up as "emerging", this is done discretionary and helps
differentiate from the rest of the pools and tokens.

Emerging tokens will show differently for those who swap, vote and generally
across the liquidity screens.

Emerging tokens can graduate seamlessly to receive staking rewards without any
additional migration.

Graduation to staking rewards does not unlock or change
any underlying deposits.

## Fees

Aero Launcher charges no fees and is completely permissionless.

Other products launching and locking their liquidity can
provide a referral/beneficiary for sharing the fees or staking rewards.

The fees or staking rewards can be claimed any time as soon as these accrue.
If there's a referral/beneficiary share set, it will be calculated and
redirected at claim time automatically.
